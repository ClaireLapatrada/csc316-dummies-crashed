    <h1 class="title">Crossing is Dangerous</h1>

    <p class="subtitle">
        Pedestrian collisions reveal a stark reality: crossing the street is one of the most dangerous activities for pedestrians in Toronto.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
        The data shows that a significant portion of pedestrian-involved collisions occur while pedestrians are crossing roadways. Whether crossing at marked crosswalks, unmarked intersections, or mid-block locations, pedestrians face substantial risks when navigating vehicle traffic.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
        Many of these collisions involve pedestrians crossing without the right-of-way, often because they misjudge vehicle speeds, gaps in traffic, or because infrastructure fails to provide safe crossing opportunities. When pedestrians must cross multiple lanes of traffic or navigate complex intersections, the danger increases exponentially.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
        The vulnerability of pedestrians during crossing is compounded by factors such as driver distraction, speeding, and failure to yield. Even when pedestrians have the legal right-of-way, they remain at risk from drivers who are not paying attention or who do not expect pedestrians in certain locations.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
        To address this critical safety issue, we need better pedestrian infrastructure including more visible crosswalks, pedestrian-activated signals, refuge islands for multi-lane roads, and traffic calming measures that force drivers to slow down and pay attention. Making crossing safer is essential to protecting the most vulnerable road users.

    <p class="section">
        There is no shortage of delays that occur during our commutes—no doubt due to construction, limited road infrastructure, limited public transportation options, and <strong>traffic collisions</strong>, the most quantifiable and preventable of these reasons. The city is actively attempting to resolve these issues through the Gardiner Expressway rehabilitation plan, the removal of bike lanes, and the removal of speed cameras; but how can we tell if these changes are truly making a difference in the rate of traffic collisions?

        The following visualizations will examine what factors are causing these collisions and whether the infrastructures thus far can successfully prevent collisions. In doing so, we will soon find out what other countermeasures can be put in place to further prevent collisions.

            Scarborough shows some of the highest collision counts throughout the year.
            It remains one of the more dangerous areas in the city,
            yet it still is under-addressed compared to how often incidents happen there.

        <div class="insight-text">
            Measures like rumble strips, anti-icing technology, improved street lighting,
            and dynamic speed signs are strong options for reducing collisions.
            However, most of these upgrades suggestions are focused in downtown Toronto,
            which seems to get a lot of benefit form it.

            Mean collision numbers have slowly declined over time.
            The drop isn’t dramatic, but it shows steady progress in improving road safety.

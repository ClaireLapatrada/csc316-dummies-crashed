    <h1 class="title">Scarborough’s Collision Hotspot Problem</h1>

    <p class="subtitle">
        Scarborough shows some of the highest collision counts throughout the year.
        It remains one of the more dangerous areas in the city,
        yet it still is under-addressed compared to how often incidents happen there.

    </p>

    <p class="section">
        Mean collision numbers have slowly declined over time.
        The drop isn’t dramatic, but it shows steady progress in improving road safety.

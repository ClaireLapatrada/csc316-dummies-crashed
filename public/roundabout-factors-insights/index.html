    <h1 class="title">3 Big Factor</h1>

    <p class="subtitle">
        When analyzing collision data across Toronto, three major factors consistently emerge as the primary contributors to traffic accidents.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
        The first major factor is collisions occurring at intersections. Intersections are complex traffic environments where multiple streams of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists converge, creating numerous conflict points. The high concentration of decision-making moments and the need for precise timing make intersections particularly dangerous.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
        The second critical factor is speeding-related incidents. When drivers exceed speed limits, they reduce their reaction time and increase the severity of collisions. Speeding makes it harder to stop safely, navigate turns, and respond to unexpected situations, turning minor incidents into serious accidents.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
        The third significant factor is aggressive or distracted driving. This includes behaviors such as tailgating, sudden lane changes, and driver distraction from phones or other devices. These behaviors reduce situational awareness and create unpredictable traffic patterns that lead to collisions.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
        Together, these three factors account for a substantial portion of Toronto's traffic collisions. Addressing intersection safety through better design, enforcing speed limits, and promoting attentive driving can significantly reduce accidents and make our streets safer for everyone.
